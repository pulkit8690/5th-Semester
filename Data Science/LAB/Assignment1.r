#1.Assign and print the values 23.4, 45 and 678 to the variables A, B, C.

A<-23.4
B<-45
C<-678

#2.Display the entire variable you have created on the screen.
ls()

#3.Remove the variable C and display the list.
rm(C)
ls()

#4.Create a comment “I am learning R”
#I am Learning R

#5.Create strings firstname and lastname as “MyName” and “MySurname”
firstname<-"Pulkit"
lastname<-"Arora"

#6.Create the variable that can hold a value as 0 or 1.
a=1
a=0

#7. Perform the operation as +, -, * and / on variables A, B, C together.
A+B+C
A-B-C
A*B*C
A/B/C

#8.Apply the following functions on some values:
 # Exp(), log(), log10(), log2(), pi, sqrt()
exp(2)
log(2)
log10(2)
log2(2)
pi
sqrt(25)

#9.Write the statement to solve the following expressions:
  #1. 23 + (4.5 * 2.3) / 10
23 + (4.5 * 2.3) / 10
  #2. 456 / 12 – log(90)
456/12 - log(90)

#3. Exp(5) + 12 / (5 ^ 6)
